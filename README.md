# Simulation-of-sorting-techniques

 The five sorting techniques which we have implemented are-
• Bubble Sort
• Insertion Sort
• Selection Sort
• Merge Sort
• Quick Sort

Data sets: crafted four data sets such that two data sets are synthetic (drawn from a distribution) and two data sets that are real (research some real data sets online.)  

Ran a set of simulation experiments that evaluate the following performance measures [on the y-axis] (a) run time (b) memory usage against the following parameters [on the x-axis] (a) data size, (b) degree of data sortedness.

Name of the Algorithm    Time Complexity / Space Complexity
Bubble Sort           -        O (n^2) / O (1)
Selection Sort        -        O (n^2) / O (1)
Insertion Sort        -        O (n^2) / O (1)
Merge Sort            -        O (n log n) / O (n)
Quick Sort            -        O (n log n)/ O (n)

From the Simulations, we have observed that the run time for Insertion sort, Selection Sort and Bubble Sort was much higher than
Quick sort and Merge sort which represents the respective running times. Similarly, we also observe that the memory usage is
higher for Quick sort and Merge sort when compared to other studied algorithms again representing the space complexity for the
algorithms.
